    "query": "Is the address \"557 County Road 3610, Whitney, Texas 76692\" located in Hill County or Bosque County? Are there any properties near Whitney, Texas that are in Bosque County, or is Whitney entirely in Hill County? Please clarify the exact county boundary in this area.",
    "response": "**The address 557 County Road 3610, Whitney, Texas 76692 is located in Hill County.** Whitney is primarily in Hill County, with its core areas\u2014including the city center and Lake Whitney State Park\u2014firmly within Hill County boundaries[1][5][6]. County Road 3610 (CR 3610) runs through Whitney in Hill County, as shown on the official Hill County map, which labels Whitney and nearby roads like CR 3602 explicitly within the county[5].\n\nProperties near Whitney **do exist in Bosque County**, particularly west and south across the Brazos River and Lake Whitney reservoir, which forms part of the eastern Bosque County border[2][3][4][6]. Bosque County includes areas like Clifton (with a 76634 ZIP code overlapping Whitney's region) and the western shore of Lake Whitney[2][6].\n\n**The exact county boundary** follows the Brazos River and Lake Whitney, placing eastern/western Whitney in Hill County and adjacent western lakefront/rural areas in Bosque County[1][2][3][4][5][6]. A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers map labels Whitney city areas and Lake Whitney State Park under Hill County jurisdiction, while noting Bosque County nearby[6]. For precise verification of 557 CR 3610, consult Hill County Appraisal District records or GIS tools, as the 2007 Hill County map confirms CR 3610 near Whitney Lake within Hill boundaries[5]. Adjacent counties are Bosque (west of Hill) and Hill (east of Bosque)[1][2]."
