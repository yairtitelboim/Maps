    "response": "**No recent news articles directly confirm active data center projects in Hill County, Texas.** The provided search results highlight developments in nearby counties like Bosque (Thad Hill Energy Center) and Hays (San Marcos area), but none specify Hill County.[1][2][4]\n\n### Key Nearby Projects (Not in Hill County)\n- **CyrusOne at Thad Hill Energy Center (Bosque County)**: On November 3, 2025, Calpine and CyrusOne announced Phase 2 of a powered land agreement, adding 210MW to the initial 190MW (total 400MW) for a hyperscale data center adjacent to the Thad Hill Energy Center. Construction is underway, with operations expected by Q4 2026.[2][6]\n- **Sabey Data Centers and Partners (Hays County, near San Marcos)**: San Marcos City Council considered a development agreement for a \"state-of-the-art\" data center on 184 acres of a 786-acre site southeast of Old Bastrop Road and Francis Harris Lane, tied to Sabey Data Centers and Carson Properties. This would be the third proposed center near Hays Energy Power Plant; city staff recommended approval, but status is pending council vote. Related proposals include CloudBurst Data Centers on 96 acres at 2955 Francis Harris Lane (purchased February, founded 2022) and a 200-acre site at 904 Francis Harris Lane seeking rezoning from residential to light industrial (previously recommended for denial in March).[1][4]\n- **Other Texas Projects**: In McLennan County (near Waco), Infrakey is negotiating a $10B data center on 520 acres west of Elm Mott, including a 1.2GW gas-fired plant; early stages with potential groundbreaking in 2026. CyrusOne also filed for expansion outside Waco (DFW17, $375M, construction October 2025\u2013December 2026).[3][7]\n\n### Limitations\nSearch results lack specific announcements, construction updates, or investments for Hill County itself as of December 2025. Broader Texas trends show data center growth driven by AI demand, often near power plants, but no Hill County matches were found.[1][2][3][8] Environmental concerns, like a call for a federal moratorium on new builds, are emerging regionally.[8]"

    "query": "What energy infrastructure or power projects are related to data centers in Hill County, Texas?",
    "response": "The key energy infrastructure tied to data\u2011center activity in the area around **Hill County** is centered just across the county line in **Bosque County**, where Calpine and CyrusOne are building a tightly integrated power\u2013data center complex at the **Thad Hill Energy Center**. Public information to date points to this Bosque County project (immediately adjacent to Hill County) as the main dedicated power development serving hyperscale data centers in that part of Central Texas, rather than distinct large power projects located inside Hill County itself.[1][2][3][5][8]\n\nBelow are the relevant projects and how they relate to data\u2011center power demand in the Hill/Bosque region:\n\n### 1. Thad Hill Energy Center & CyrusOne \u201cDFW10\u201d (Bosque County, adjacent to Hill County)\n\n- **Location and relationship to Hill County**\n  - The **Thad Hill Energy Center** is a natural\u2011gas power plant in **Bosque County, Texas**, with the new data\u2011center campus sited *adjacent* to the plant.[1][2]  \n  - Bosque County borders Hill County; this project is effectively the primary dedicated power hub for hyperscale data\u2011center growth in that immediate region, even though the plant and campus are on the Bosque side of the county line.\n\n- **Core power\u2013data center structure**\n  - **Calpine Corporation** (large U.S. gas and geothermal generator) and **CyrusOne** (hyperscale data\u2011center developer) have structured what Calpine markets as a **\u201cPowered Land\u201d** solution: Calpine provides **dedicated generation, grid interconnection and site infrastructure** specifically for CyrusOne\u2019s campus next to Thad Hill.[1][2][5][8]\n  - The **Thad Hill Energy Center** is a **natural\u2011gas power plant** with existing capacity of about **250 MW**, and Calpine has stated plans to expand its **ERCOT portfolio** such that it can deliver **up to 400 MW** of power to data centers located in Bosque, Texas.[3][2][1]\n\n- **Power agreements and expansions**\n  - **Phase 1 agreement (190 MW):**  \n    - Announced July 30, 2025: Calpine agreed to supply **190 MW** to a new CyrusOne hyperscale data center built adjacent to Thad Hill, including power, grid connection, and land for the facility.[1][2]  \n    - This first phase underpins CyrusOne\u2019s new campus (internal name **DFW10**) and secures the initial power block necessary for construction and operation.[1]\n  - **Phase 2 expansion (up to 400 MW total):**  \n    - Announced November 3, 2025: Calpine and CyrusOne executed **Phase 2** of their Powered Land agreement, expanding the power supply arrangement to **400 MW** for the same data\u2011center site.[5][8]  \n    - Calpine describes this as leveraging its ~9,000 MW ERCOT fleet and transmission platform to deliver **up to 400 MW** of dedicated capacity to data centers at the Thad Hill location.[1][2][5][8]\n\n- **Data\u2011center campus characteristics (energy\u2011linked design)**\n  - The CyrusOne campus, referred to as **DFW10**, is a **multiphase hyperscale campus**:\n    - Initial phase footprint: more than **190,000 square feet**.[1][2]  \n    - Designed to be **scalable** to additional IT load over time, synchronized with the incremental power Calpine can deliver.[1][2][5]\n  - The facility is designed with:\n    - **Climate\u2011neutral initiatives**,  \n    - **Water conservation measures**,  \n    - **Biodiversity protection**, and  \n    - Features to respond to **ERCOT grid emergencies**, indicating both on\u2011site and contractual mechanisms to support grid reliability (e.g., curtailment or demand\u2011response capability).[1][2]\n  - CyrusOne and Calpine emphasize that the integrated power\u2011campus design is intended as a **model for future hyperscale developments in Texas**, focusing on **reliable, scalable power** for AI and cloud workloads while supporting the broader ERCOT system.[1][5][8]\n\n- **Planned timeline**\n  - The new campus is currently under construction and is expected to be **operational by Q4 2026 / end of 2026**, aligned with the 190\u2011MW initial supply and then ramping toward the 400\u2011MW expanded agreement.[1][2]\n\n- **Local and regional impact**\n  - State Rep. **Angelia Orr** (who represents parts of Central Texas including Bosque and Hill areas) has publicly backed the project, framing it as a"
