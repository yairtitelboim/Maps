    "response": "Hill County currently has **utility\u2011scale hydro and solar generation** and additional large solar under development; there are **no major utility\u2011scale wind farms or known grid\u2011scale batteries** registered in the county based on available public sources.\n\nBelow is a breakdown by technology and operator, with adjacent\u2011county context where relevant.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Hydroelectric generation in Hill County\n\n**Whitney Dam / Lake Whitney Hydroelectric Plant**\n\n- **Location:** On the Brazos River at Lake Whitney, on the border of **Bosque and Hill counties**.[4]  \n- **Technology:** Conventional **hydroelectric**.  \n- **Nameplate capacity:** **43 MW**.[4]  \n- **Owner / Operator:** **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers**.[4]  \n- **County relevance:** The facility is listed as being in **Bosque and Hill counties**, so its 43 MW capacity is typically attributed jointly to both counties in statewide inventories.[4]\n\n*Hill County contribution (generation physically in the county):*  \n- **Hydro capacity in-county:** **up to 43 MW (shared with Bosque County)**.  \n- **Operator:** U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Utility\u2011scale solar in Hill County\n\n#### a. Ash Creek Solar Project (operating)\n\n- **Project:** **Ash Creek Solar**.  \n- **Location:** Hill County, between **Penelope and Abbott**, strategically between Austin and Dallas.[1][2]  \n- **Nameplate capacity:** **408 MW** (utility\u2011scale PV).[2]  \n- **Developer / Owner\u2011operator:** **Primergy Solar** (Primergy Renewable Energy).[2]  \n- **Land & scale:** About **3,000 acres** with nearly twenty landowners.[2]  \n- **Status:** Described by Primergy as an operating project providing low\u2011cost energy and ongoing O&M jobs.[2]  \n- **Offtake:** Under a **long\u2011term power deal with Microsoft** for the plant\u2019s entire capacity.[1]  \n- **Economic impact:** Roughly **350 construction jobs**, ~**6 permanent O&M jobs**, and an estimated **$100 million** in economic development and tax benefits over 30 years for Hill County.[1][2]\n\n#### b. \u201cThree W\u201d Solar Project (110 MWac) \u2013 in/near Hill County\n\n- **Project:** **Three W Solar**.  \n- **Capacity:** **110 MWac** PV.[6]  \n- **Location:** Identified as being **\u201clocated in Hill County, Texas\u201d** in project sale reporting.[6]  \n- **Developer / Seller:** **OCI Solar Power** (original developer).[6]  \n- **Buyer / Owner:** **Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc.** (Mitsui USA purchased the project from OCI Solar Power).[6]  \n- **Status:** Public reporting focuses on the sale transaction; ERCOT/PUC filings (not in the snippet) would be needed to confirm current operational status and COD. The project is generally treated as a **utility\u2011scale solar asset associated with Hill County**.[6]\n\nBecause ERCOT\u2019s unit\u2011level registry is not in the search results, the exact in\u2011service date and whether all 110 MWac are physically inside Hill County\u2019s boundary cannot be fully confirmed here, but all available reporting ties the project nameplate capacity to Hill County.[6]\n\n#### Hill County solar totals (utility\u2011scale)\n\nBased on available public data:\n\n- **Ash Creek Solar:** **408 MW** (Primergy Solar).[2]  \n- **Three W Solar:** **110 MWac** (Mitsui USA / ex\u2011OCI Solar Power).[6]\n\n**Approximate total utility\u2011scale solar capacity associated with Hill County:**  \n- **\u2248 518 MW** of PV (assuming the full 110 MWac Three W project is in Hill County).\n\n**Primary solar operators in/for Hill County:**\n\n- **Primergy Solar** \u2013 owns/operates **Ash Creek Solar (408 MW)**.[2]  \n- **Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc.** \u2013 owner of **Three W Solar (110 MWac)** developed by OCI Solar Power.[6]  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Natural gas\u2011fired generation in or directly tied to Hill County\n\nPublic statewide plant lists and the Texas Wikipedia compilation of power stations do **not list any utility\u2011scale gas\u2011fired plants in Hill County** itself.[4] The only generation asset explicitly tagged to Hill County in that list is the **Whitney Dam hydro facility** (shared with Bosque).[4]\n\nNearby, however, there are relevant gas\u2011fired resources that influence grid support for Hill County:\n\n- **Thad Hill Energy Center \u2013 Bosque County (adjacent county)**  \n  - A Calpine\u2011owned **natural gas\u2011fired plant** in **Bosque County**, just across the Hill County line.  \n  - Calpine describes its roughly **9,000 MW ERCOT fleet** being used to support up to **400 MW** of delivered capacity to data centers located in **Bosque, Texas**, anchored by a new hyperscale campus adjacent to the **Thad Hill Energy Center**.[3]  \n  - This facility is not in Hill County, but it is a primary **dispatchable gas resource** directly adjacent and is poised to support new large loads and grid reliability in the region.[3]\n\nBased on the available sources:\n\n- **Utility\u2011scale gas generation located in Hill County:** **None identified** in major public plant lists.[4]  \n- **Closest large gas plant:** **Thad Hill Energy Center (Calpine) in Bosque County**.[3]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Wind generation in Hill County\n\nThe statewide list of Texas wind farms and major ERCOT\u2011scale wind projects does **not include any wind farm sited in Hill County**.[4]\n\n- Numerous wind projects are listed in other counties (e.g., Notrees, Palo Duro, Panhandle, Panther Creek), but **none are attributed to Hill County** in the referenced compilation.[4]\n\nSo, based on current public data:\n\n- **Utility\u2011scale wind in Hill County:** **0 MW** identified.  \n- **Wind operators in adjacent counties:** None directly tied to Hill County in the provided sources.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Grid\u2011scale battery storage in Hill County\n\nThe search results and the Texas PUC power\u2011generator directory index do **not show a specific grid\u2011scale battery energy storage system (BESS) in Hill County**.[9]\n\n- The PUC **Alphabetical Directory of Power Generators** lists many storage entities statewide (e.g., entities with \u201cESS\u201d in the name), but no specific **Hill County\u2011sited BESS** is surfaced in the snippets.[9]  \n- ERCOT and PUC project\u2011by\u2011county detail would be needed to rule out very small or recently registered systems, but nothing in the public summaries specifically flags a Hill County battery project.\n\nThus:\n\n- **Utility\u2011scale battery storage in Hill County:** **No named projects identified** from available sources.  \n- **Operators:** None confirmed in\u2011count"

    "query": "What ERCOT transmission planning, grid infrastructure, or interconnection projects are planned or underway in Hill County, Texas? Include transmission lines, substations, and grid upgrades.",
    "response": "ERCOT and Oncor have one major **approved 345\u2011kV transmission upgrade that directly involves Hill County**, plus a broader ERCOT planning constraint affecting new interconnections in the county. No ERCOT-endorsed 765\u2011kV projects or new substations are sited in Hill County itself as of late 2025; activity is focused on rebuilding existing 345\u2011kV infrastructure between Hill and adjacent Ellis County and managing stability constraints on new generation.\n\nBelow are the key items.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Oncor Venus Switch \u2013 Sam Switch 345\u2011kV Line Project (Ellis & Hill Counties)\n\n**Scope and purpose**\n\n- ERCOT\u2019s Regional Planning Group and Technical Advisory Committee have endorsed a **Tier 1 reliability project** to rebuild Oncor\u2019s 345\u2011kV circuits between **Venus Switch, Fort Smith Switch, and Sam Switch** in **Ellis and Hill Counties** to relieve thermal overloads and meet NERC/ERCOT planning criteria.[3]  \n- ERCOT\u2019s independent review found thermal overloads on **81.5 miles of 345\u2011kV transmission lines in Ellis and Hill Counties** under contingency conditions, prompting the project.[3]\n\n**Major components**\n\nERCOT\u2019s recommended Option 1 includes the following **system improvements within the Ellis/Hill corridor**:[3]\n\n- **Rebuild Venus Switch \u2013 Fort Smith Switch 345\u2011kV line**  \n  - Length: approximately **17.8 miles**.[3]  \n  - Target ratings: **normal and emergency ratings of 1912 MVA or greater**.[3]\n\n- **Rebuild Venus Switch \u2013 Sam Switch 345\u2011kV line**  \n  - Additional mileage (along with other segments) makes up the **81.5 miles** of 345\u2011kV circuit being upgraded in Ellis and Hill Counties overall.[3]  \n  - Also to be upgraded to **\u22651912 MVA** normal/emergency ratings.[3]\n\n- The project is framed explicitly as needed \u201cto address thermal overloads in the **Ellis and Hill Counties** in the North Central Weather Zone.\u201d[3]\n\n**Cost, schedule, status**\n\n- **Estimated project cost:** **$118.9 million** (ERCOT recommendation, Option 1).[3]  \n- **Tier level:** **Tier 1** project under ERCOT Protocol Section 3.11.4.7 (requires Board endorsement).[3]  \n- **In\u2011service date:** **May 2026 (expected)**.[3]  \n- ERCOT presented the project to TAC on **January 22, 2025**, and TAC voted **unanimously to endorse** the project.[3]  \n- As a Tier 1 project endorsed by TAC, it is effectively moving forward as the selected solution to the reliability need in **Ellis + Hill Counties**.\n\n**Relevance to Hill County**\n\n- While the PDF describes the project at a county\u2011pair level (\u201cEllis and Hill Counties\u201d), the **Sam Switch** and affected 345\u2011kV corridor run through the **northern Hill County / southern Ellis County** interface.[3]  \n- For any large load or generation in northern Hill County, this project is the **primary planned bulk\u2011power upgrade** in ERCOT\u2019s current portfolio, materially increasing 345\u2011kV transfer capability and headroom for future interconnections in that area.\n\n---\n\n### 2. ERCOT \u201cSAMSW\u201d Generic Transmission Constraint & Restrictions on New Inverter\u2011Based Resources in Hill County\n\n**Constraint and restriction**\n\n- On **July 11, 2025**, ERCOT issued a Market Notice reinforcing **restrictions on new inverter\u2011based generation (IBR) at transmission voltage in Hill County** and in the nearby 345\u2011kV area known as the **SAMSW Generic Transmission Constraint (GTC)**.[2]  \n- ERCOT\u2019s stability evaluation concluded that **any new inverter\u2011based resources**, regardless of dispatch level, pose an **unacceptable stability risk** under certain multiple\u2011contingency conditions in this Hill County\u2013centered 345\u2011kV pocket, unless mitigations are implemented.[2]  \n\n**Effect on interconnection projects**\n\n- The restriction applies to **all proposed generators** in the affected area that have **not yet received Part 2 approval** in the ERCOT Generation Interconnection process.[2]  \n- Developers in Hill County (and within the SAMSW 345\u2011kV GTC area) must now satisfy additional requirements or face significant constraints on output or connection timing until ERCOT identifies and implements a transmission solution to relax the GTC.[2]  \n- ERCOT states it is **evaluating possible transmission upgrades** that could allow eventual removal or modification of the SAMSW constraint, and will update the GTC methodology and publish changes once a solution is identified.[2]\n\n**Implications**\n\n- Although specific upgrade projects to resolve SAMSW have not yet been published (no named line rebuilds or new substations tied explicitly to this GTC in Hill County as of late 2025), this Market Notice signals that **future ERCOT transmission planning in the Hill County 345\u2011kV area is active and ongoing**, driven by stability rather than just thermal limits.[2]  \n- Any **new grid\u2011scale solar, wind, BESS, or other inverter\u2011based projects** in Hill County will be directly affected by this constraint in their **ERCOT interconnection studies**, curtailment risk, and required mitigation measures.[2]\n\n---\n\n### 3. 765\u2011kV and Other Major Backbone Projects \u2013 Not in Hill County but Relevant Context\n\nNo ERCOT\u2011approved 765\u2011kV or other high\u2011voltage backbone projects cross **Hill County** itself as of late 2025. However, several major 765\u2011kV initiatives elsewhere in the ERCOT system may indirectly affect regional transfer capability and planning assumptions that include the Waco\u2013Dallas\u2013Fort Worth area.\n\nExamples from current ERCOT/LCRA/AEP/CPS/Oncor documents (all **outside Hill County**):\n\n- **Bell County East \u2013 Big Hill 765\u2011kV Transmission Project (LCRA TSC & Oncor)**  \n  - New **765\u2011kV import path** from **Bell County East Switch (Bell County)** to a new **Big Hill 765\u2011kV Substation (Schleicher County)**, ordered by the PUCT in April 2025 as part of the Permian Basin Reliability Plan.[1][4]  \n  - Study area spans Bell, Burnet, Concho, Coryell, Lampasas, Llano, Mason, McCulloch, Menard, Milam, San Saba, Schleicher, Tom Green, and Williamson counties\u2014**not Hill County**.[1]  \n  - Joint CCN filing expected **March 2026**; estimated in\u2011service **summer 2030**.[1]\n\n- **STEP Eastern Backbone 765\u2011kV project** (AEP Texas, CPS Energy, Oncor, CenterPoint)  \n  - Involves **765\u2011kV lines and substations in Bexar, Dallas, Bell, Kleberg, Rusk, Wharton counties**, with no facility sited in Hill County.[5]\n\n- **Othe"

    "query": "What is the current and projected energy demand in Hill County, Texas? Are there any major industrial users, data centers, or large electricity consumers in the county? What is driving energy demand growth?",
    "response": "Hill County, Texas, currently consumes approximately **583,000 MWh of electricity annually** (calculated as 60.68% of its 908,792 MWh local generation, with the remainder exported).[1] No specific projected demand figures are available for the county, though statewide ERCOT forecasts indicate Texas energy demand could double by 2030, driven primarily by data centers and large industrial loads.[6]\n\n### Major Industrial Users, Data Centers, or Large Electricity Consumers\n- No data centers, crypto mining facilities, or other major industrial electricity consumers are identified in Hill County.[1][5]\n- The county hosts **5 active power generation plants**, primarily renewables:\n  | Plant Name/Owner | Location | Type | Capacity (MW) | Annual Generation (MWh) |\n  |------------------|----------|------|---------------|--------------------------|\n  | Pitts Dudik Solar (Pitts Dudik Solar, LLC) | Hubbard | Solar | 102 | 80,276[1] |\n  | TPE Whitney Solar (Alchemy Renewable Energy) | Hill County | Solar | 122 | 18,844[1] |\n  | Ash Creek Solar (Primergy Solar) | Hill County | Solar | 408 | Not specified (reached commercial operation in 2025)[3] |\n  | Whitney Hydro | Hill County (US Army Corps of Engineers) | Hydroelectric | 14 | 2,467[1] |\n  | Other solar/hydro facilities | Various | Solar/Hydro | Varies | Contributes to total 940,823 MWh renewables[1] |\n- **HILCO Electric** serves the most customers (20,205 estimated), followed by TXU Energy (12,523).[1] The county ranks 231st in Texas for electricity costs at $164.81/month average for residential users.[1]\n\n### Drivers of Energy Demand Growth\n- **Local generation surplus**: Hill County produces more electricity (940,823 MWh, 100% renewables) than it consumes, exporting ~39% for use elsewhere, which supports regional growth but does not indicate local demand pressure.[1]\n- **Statewide context influencing Hill County** (via ERCOT grid and transmission lines owned by Oncor and Navarro County Electric Coop):\n  - Data centers (591 MW leased in Dallas-Fort Worth in prior year; 279 statewide as of September 2025) and crypto mining represent the largest share of new large-load connections (5,496 MW approved, potentially reaching 9,500 MW by end-2025).[5]\n  - Industrial electrification, population growth, and AI/data processing are key factors, with ERCOT predicting the biggest demand surge from data centers.[6]\n  - Texas industrial sector alone exceeds any other state's total energy use.[4]\n- The **408 MW Ash Creek Solar project** (operational 2025, partnered with Microsoft via PPA) boosts export capacity and local tax revenue ($100 million over project life) but serves grid-wide needs rather than county consumption.[3] No evidence ties it directly to local demand growth."

The most relevant nearby activity is in **Hays County** (adjacent to Travis and Caldwell counties, but part of the broader Central Texas \"Hill Country\" region often referenced in data center news), approximately 100-120 miles southwest of Hill County. This cluster near the Hays Energy Power Plant could indirectly impact regional power infrastructure, including ERCOT grid strain that affects Hill County[1][9].\n\n- **Sabey Data Centers / Carson Properties Partnership**:\n  - **Project**: State-of-the-art data center on 184 acres (part of a 786-acre site southeast of Old Bastrop Road and Francis Harris Lane, abutting the Hays Energy Power Plant at 1601 Francis Harris Lane, 7.5 miles south of San Marcos).\n  - **Details**: Includes an electrical substation from Pedernales Electric Cooperative; at least 392 acres preserved as open space; future neighborhood planned on remainder.\n  - **Timeline**: San Marcos City Council scheduled to vote on authorizing negotiations for a development agreement (city staff recommends approval); agenda item from recent council meeting.\n  - **Power**: Not specified, but proximity to natural gas power plant indicates direct energy tie-in for AI/data processing demands[1].\n  - **Status**: Third proposed data center in a 1.5-mile cluster; signed by John Wilson (Sabey CFO) and John David Carson (Carson Properties).\n\n- **CloudBurst Data Centers** (Denver-based, founded 2022):\n  - **Project**: Data center on 96 acres (95.9 acres purchased February 2025) at 2955 Francis Harris Lane.\n  - **Details**: \"Next-Gen Flagship Gigacenter\" with modular design and advanced cooling for AI/high-density computing; entity Data Center LB LP linked to CloudBurst.\n  - **Timeline**: Land acquired February 2025; facing local opposition from Hill Country residents.\n  - **Power**: Not specified[1][7][9].\n\n- **Unnamed / Light Industrial Rezoning Project**:\n  - **Project**: Data center on 200 acres at 904 Francis Harris Lane (about 2 miles from CloudBurst site).\n  - **Details**: Owners seeking rezoning from \"character district 2.5\" (single-family residential) to light industrial; San Marcos Planning and Zoning Commission recommended denial in March, but council to receive public comment.\n  - **Timeline**: Council consideration ongoing alongside others.\n  - **Power**: Not specified; part of the same power plant-adjacent cluster[1].\n\n### Broader Texas Context (No Hill County Ties)\nTexas Comptroller lists over 50 qualifying data centers/large projects statewide, but none in Hill County or its adjacents (e.g., Riot Corsicana in Navarro County ~50 miles northeast, 2023; Red Oak in Ellis County ~60 miles north, Microsoft/Compass 2022-2024). No projects in Bosque, Erath, Limestone, or McLennan noted. Microsoft's $1.5B in Castroville (Medina County, ~100 miles southwest) is in \"Hill Country\" but distant[2][6].\n\nSearch results lack specifics on power MW for Hays projects or direct Hill County impacts; grid effects from Central Texas AI clusters may strain ERCOT-wide capacity[1][2]."

    "query": "Are there any connections between energy infrastructure and data center development in Hill County, Texas? Include power purchase agreements, dedicated power infrastructure, or coordinated development between energy companies and data center operators.",
    "response": "There is **no public evidence yet of a data center physically located in Hill County, Texas that is co\u2011developed with dedicated power infrastructure or a named PPA specifically tied to a Hill County data center**, but there are clear, documented links between **energy infrastructure in Hill County and data center development elsewhere in Texas** via Meta\u2019s renewable\u2011energy contracting strategy and nearby \u201cpowered land\u201d projects.\n\nBelow is what is documented and how it connects to Hill County and adjacent counties.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Direct energy\u2013digital link in Hill County: Meta\u2019s solar offtake\n\nMeta has explicitly tied **Texas solar projects** to powering its **data centers**, and this includes a project in **Hill County**:\n\n- In 2024\u20132025 coverage, Meta is reported to be using solar in Texas to power its data centers and has signed multiple long\u2011term power agreements and environmental attribute deals to support that strategy.[4][5]  \n- Alongside ~650 MW of solar offtake from AES projects, Meta signed **Environmental Attribute Purchase Agreements (EAPAs)** for two more Texas solar farms developed by Sunraycer Renewables:[4][5]  \n  - **Midpoint Solar** \u2013 **127 MWdc (97.5 MWac)** in **Hill County, Texas**.[4][5]  \n  - **Gaia Solar** \u2013 **184 MWdc (143 MWac)** in **Navarro County, Texas**.[4][5]  \n\nKey points:\n\n- The Midpoint Solar project is **physically located in Hill County**, and Meta is contracting for its **environmental attributes** (EAPAs), not necessarily all physical power output at the bus, but explicitly as part of Meta\u2019s strategy to power its **Texas data centers with solar**.[4][5]  \n- Public reporting links these solar contracts to Meta\u2019s **Texas data centre operations in general**, not to a specific facility in Hill County.[4][5]  \n\nSo, for Hill County:\n\n- **Type of instrument:** Environmental Attribute Purchase Agreement (similar in function to a \u201cvirtual\u201d PPA/REC structure rather than a behind\u2011the\u2011meter supply deal).  \n- **Counterparties:** Meta (offtaker) and Sunraycer Renewables (developer), with Midpoint Solar in **Hill County**.[4][5]  \n- **Data\u2011center linkage:** Meta is aggregating these contracts to support the load from its Texas data centers, connecting **Hill County solar infrastructure** to **regional data center electricity demand**, even though the data centers appear to be sited elsewhere in ERCOT.[4][5]  \n\nThere is **no public indication** that Meta or another operator is building a data center in Hill County itself or that ONCOR/another utility has built **dedicated substation or transmission upgrades specifically for a Hill County data center**. The link is instead through **contracted renewable supply (EAPAs) from Hill County feeding broader Texas data center load**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Coordinated power\u2013data center developments nearby (Bosque & McLennan)\n\nWhile not in Hill County, neighboring and regional projects show the exact kind of **co\u2011designed energy infrastructure\u2013data center model** you asked about, and they draw from the same ERCOT West/Central grid area.\n\n#### a. Calpine\u2013CyrusOne powered\u2011land deal at Thad Hill Energy Center (Bosque County)\n\n- **Location:** Adjacent Bosque County, immediately west/northwest of Hill County.  \n- **Parties:** Calpine Corporation (generation / energy services) and CyrusOne (hyperscale data center developer).[1][3][6]  \n- **Structure:**  \n  - A **190 MW power supply and \u201cpowered land\u201d agreement** announced July 30, 2025, to serve a new hyperscale data center next to the **Thad Hill Energy Center** natural gas plant in Bosque County.[1][3]  \n  - Calpine is marketing its **Powered Land Capabilities (PLC)** \u2013 effectively a bundled product of land, interconnection, and dedicated power infrastructure for large loads like data centers.[1]  \n  - Calpine\u2019s ERCOT fleet (~**9,000 MW** of generation and power marketing platform) is positioned to deliver **up to 400 MW to data centers** in Bosque County under this PLC framework.[1][3][6]  \n- **Phase 2:** In November 2025, Calpine announced **Phase 2** of the agreement, expanding the overall **power supply arrangement to 400 MW** for the CyrusOne site at Thad Hill.[6]  \n- **Data center project:**  \n  - CyrusOne\u2019s campus (often referred to as **DFW10**) is described as a **multiphase hyperscale data center** with an initial ~190,000 sq ft first phase and a total project value of about **$1.2 billion**.[1][3]  \n  - Construction is under way and expected to be **operational by Q4 2026**.[1][3]  \n\nThis is a textbook example of **dedicated power infrastructure jointly planned and contracted with a data center operator**:\n\n- Co\u2011location of a **large natural gas power plant (Thad Hill)** and a hyperscale data center campus.  \n- **Long\u2011term power supply agreement** (190 MW initially, 400 MW total PLC) that combines **power, grid connection, and land** in one deal.[1][3][6]  \n- Calpine is planning to **expand the Thad Hill Energy Center** specifically to support this data center load.[2]  \n\nWhile this is **Bosque County**, it sits in the same broader region as Hill County and demonstrates how **developers are pairing energy infrastructure and data centers in rural Central Texas counties**.\n\n#### b. Lacy Lakeview / Waco megaproject (McLennan County)\n\n- A separate proposal in **Lacy Lakeview (north of Waco, McLennan County)** envisions a **$10 billion data center project** receiving local approvals; commentary from state media notes that facilities of this scale are expected to initially run on **Texas natural gas** with plans to incorporate more renewables over time.[9][10]  \n- Public information emphasizes **very large power requirements** and coordination with ERCOT and local utilities, though concrete PPAs or named dedicated plants are not as detailed as in the Calpine\u2013CyrusOne deal.[9][10]  \n\nThis underscores that in the Waco\u2013Bosque\u2013Hill County region, **data center growth is increasingly being planned together with substantial new or expanded power infrastructure**, predominantly natural gas plus contracted renewables.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How Hill County fits into this regional pattern\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- **Hill County\u2019s direct role**:\n  - Hosts the **127 MWdc Midpoint Solar project**, whose environmental attributes are contracted by **Meta** specifically to support its **Texas data center portfolio**.[4][5]  \n  - Functionally, Hill County is supplying **contracted renewable capacity/attributes into ERCOT** that are matched against data center loads, but the centers themselves are in other Texas locations (e.g., Meta\u2019s established campuse"

    "query": "How does Hill County fit into the broader Central Texas energy and data center landscape? What is happening in adjacent counties like Bosque, McLennan, and Johnson that might affect Hill County?",
    "response": "Hill County currently sits just outside the most intense Central Texas data center build\u2011out, but it is being increasingly \u201cboxed in\u201d by very large power\u2011anchored AI/data center projects in adjacent counties\u2014especially Bosque (to the west) and McLennan (to the northeast)\u2014that will shape transmission planning, land pricing, and regional workforce and infrastructure patterns affecting Hill County over the next decade.[1][4][8]\n\nBelow is a concise, county\u2011by\u2011county view focused on energy and data centers, then what it implies for Hill County.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Hill County\u2019s position in the Central Texas energy & data center corridor\n\n- **Geographic role**\n  - Hill County sits between the **Dallas\u2013Fort Worth (DFW)** metro to the north and **Waco\u2013Austin/San Marcos** to the south, with I\u201135, U.S. 77, and major ERCOT transmission corridors running through or near the county.  \n  - This corridor is exactly where **large AI / hyperscale data centers are clustering around gas plants and strong 345 kV transmission** in nearby counties, even if nothing of that scale is yet announced inside Hill County itself.\n\n- **Implications for Hill County (strategic, not project\u2011specific)**\n  - **Transmission & substation upgrades** driven by Bosque and McLennan projects are likely to increase available high\u2011voltage capacity in and around Hill County, making it more attractive for large loads that want slightly cheaper land and laxer siting than core metro counties.\n  - Hill County can pitch itself as:\n    - A **\u201cspillover\u201d location** for support facilities, smaller data centers, and logistics tied to Bosque/McLennan hyperscale campuses.\n    - A site for **renewable projects, batteries, or peakers** that can sell into the same constrained ERCOT zones serving those data centers.\n  - The county\u2019s future will be heavily influenced by what happens in **Bosque (Calpine/CyrusOne), McLennan (Lacy Lakeview 1\u2011GW campus), and Johnson (DFW\u2011proximate industrial growth)**.\n\n*(Direct, named hyperscale or AI data center or major gas plant projects in Hill County itself do not appear in current public sources; the county\u2019s significance is its location amid these adjacent builds.)*\n\n---\n\n### 2. Bosque County (west of Hill): Thad Hill Energy Center\u2013anchored hyperscale hub\n\nBosque County is emerging as one of the most important rural power\u2011anchored AI/data center hubs in ERCOT, about one county west of Hill.\n\n- **Calpine / CyrusOne \u2013 Thad Hill Energy Center \u201cPowered Land\u201d campus (Bosque County)**\n  - **Project:** A large **hyperscale data center campus (DFW10)** being built by **CyrusOne** directly adjacent to Calpine\u2019s **Thad Hill Energy Center** in Bosque County.[1]\n  - **Power agreement:**  \n    - July 30, 2025: Calpine announced a **190 MW** power agreement with CyrusOne to serve the new Bosque County data center, with grid connection and \u201cPowered Land\u201d (PLC) at the Thad Hill site.[1]  \n    - November 3, 2025: Calpine and CyrusOne executed **Phase 2**, adding another **210 MW**, bringing the total **dedicated capacity to 400 MW** for the Bosque facility.[4]  \n  - **Scale and investment:**\n    - First phase of the DFW10 campus is **~190,000 sq ft**, with **multiphase scalability** for future expansion.[1]\n    - Calpine has positioned this as part of its **~9,000 MW ERCOT generation and wholesale/retail platform** capable of delivering up to **400 MW to Bosque\u2011sited data centers**, signaling a much broader build\u2011out of gas generation and data center load in that zone.[1]\n  - **Infrastructure & grid role:**\n    - The campus is designed with **climate\u2011neutral initiatives, water conservation, biodiversity measures, and ERCOT emergency response capabilities**.[1]\n    - Calpine\u2019s **Powered Land Capabilities (PLC)** bundle generation, grid interconnection, and prepared land sites specifically for large\u2011load customers.[1][4]\n  - **Local & regional impact:**\n    - State Rep. Angelia Orr (who also represents parts of this broader region) has emphasized **jobs, tax base, and rural investment** in Bosque County from this project.[1]\n    - Reporting on the project notes **expansion plans for the Thad Hill gas plant** to meet the massive data center load, positioning Bosque as a **major gas\u2011plus\u2011AI node** in ERCOT.[3]\n\n**Relevance to Hill County:**\n\n- Hill County is **immediately east of Bosque**, on the natural DFW\u2013Waco\u2013Austin line.\n- Transmission expansion and system planning to move **400+ MW of new load and associated generation** through ERCOT will affect **congestion, pricing, and line upgrades** that traverse or neighbor Hill County.\n- Hill County land owners and local officials can market sites as:\n  - **Cheaper, nearby alternatives** for additional data center phases, logistics, or supplier facilities serving the Bosque hyperscale campus.\n  - Locations for **supporting generation (solar, storage, or peakers)** that want to be electrically close to high\u2011priced, data\u2011center\u2011driven load pockets.\n\n---\n\n### 3. McLennan County (northeast of Hill): 1\u2011GW Lacy Lakeview AI/data center campus\n\nMcLennan County, especially the Lacy Lakeview area just north of Waco and northeast of Hill County, is rapidly becoming another major AI/data center anchor.\n\n- **InfraKey Capital \u2013 Lacy Lakeview 1\u2011GW campus (McLennan County)**\n  - **Project:** InfraKey Capital has secured approval for a **multi\u2011building data center campus in Lacy Lakeview, Texas**, just north of Waco.[8]\n  - **Scale:**\n    - Plan is to develop **up to six data centers** with a combined capacity of **up to 1 GW (1,000 MW)** of IT load.[8]\n    - This places Lacy Lakeview among the largest proposed single\u2011site data center campuses in Texas by power.\n  - **Status and intent:**\n    - The campus has **received local approval**, signaling city\u2011level alignment to accommodate **very large power and land use**.[8]\n\n**Relevance to Hill County:**\n\n- Lacy Lakeview sits **northeast of Hill County along the I\u201135 corridor**, within the same regional labor shed and transmission zones.\n- A 1\u2011GW campus will:\n  - Drive **major transmission upgrades and substation expansions** in the Waco area that likely interact with infrastructure in or near Hill County.\n  - Intensify **competition for ERCOT capacity and interconnection queue positions** across Central Texas, raising the strategic value of any sites in Hill that are:\n    - Close to 345 kV lines or strong 138 k"

    "category": "Future Planning",
    "query": "What are the future plans for energy infrastructure expansion or data center development in Hill County, Texas? Include announced projects, regulatory filings, or development proposals for 2026 and beyond.",
    "response": "There are **no publicly documented, project-specific plans** for major **energy infrastructure expansions or data center developments located in Hill County, Texas itself for 2026 and beyond** in the available record. Current and announced large-scale projects, filings, and policy initiatives are either statewide, Permian Basin\u2013focused, or routed through other regions such as the Hill Country and West Texas, but not Hill County.\n\nBelow is what can be said with confidence, and how it affects Hill County and its surroundings.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Direct projects in Hill County, Texas\n\n- A search of recent and forward-looking **transmission project lists, ERCOT/PUC-related routing descriptions, and media reports** shows **no named transmission line, substation, generation project, or data center campus publicly tied to Hill County** specifically for 2026 or later.[1][3][6][8]  \n- The large, ERCOT\u2011driven 765\u2011kV build\u2011outs now underway or in planning (e.g., Big Hill\u2013Sand Lake, Howard\u2013Solstice) are routed in **West Texas and the Hill Country**, not through Hill County in North\u2011Central Texas.[1][3][6][7]  \n\nGiven this, **any future Hill County projects after 2026 would likely still be in early, non-public land\u2011assembly or prospecting stages**, with nothing yet in PUC dockets or major press.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Statewide and regional transmission expansions that shape future prospects\n\nEven though they are not in Hill County, several major **transmission expansion programs** will influence how and where new high-load users (like data centers) can site across ERCOT after 2026:\n\n- **Permian Basin 765\u2011kV build\u2011out (Big Hill\u2013Sand Lake and related lines)**  \n  - ERCOT\u2019s **Permian Basin Reliability Plan** was approved by the PUC in **October 2024**, and the PUC ordered new 765\u2011kV \u201cimport path\u201d projects in **April 2025**.[1]  \n  - The **Big Hill\u2013Sand Lake 765\u2011kV Project** (LCRA TSC and Oncor) will run ~177 miles between **Schleicher County (Big Hill Substation)** and **Ward County (Sand Lake Switch)**; joint **CCN filing is expected January 2026**, with a **PUC decision in summer 2026** and an **in\u2011service date targeted for summer 2030**.[1]  \n  - This is far west of Hill County; however, it **absorbs transmission planning and capital that might otherwise go toward other corridors** in ERCOT, including those that could serve North\u2011Central counties like Hill.[1][5]\n\n- **Howard\u2013Solstice 765\u2011kV Transmission Line (AEP Texas / CPS Energy)**  \n  - Approximately **370 miles of 765\u2011kV line** between CPS Energy\u2019s system near **San Antonio** and AEP\u2019s **Solstice Substation near Fort Stockton** in West Texas.[3][6]  \n  - Developed under the same 2023 **House Bill 5066** framework to support Permian Basin reliability and future economic growth.[3][6]  \n  - AEP indicates a **PUC CCN filing planned for February 2026**, with **in\u2011service by fall 2030**.[3]  \n  - This line is explicitly reported as traversing portions of the **Hill Country and Trans\u2011Pecos**, with *no routes into the tri\u2011county Big Bend region* and no reference to Hill County.[3][6][7]  \n\n- **Oncor current transmission projects**  \n  - Oncor maintains a list of active and proposed transmission projects, but currently highlighted projects (e.g., a ~39.5\u2011mile 345\u2011kV line paralleling an existing corridor) do not identify Hill County as a host jurisdiction.[8]  \n\nThese projects matter for Hill County not because they pass through it, but because they **shape ERCOT\u2019s grid topology, congestion patterns, and capital allocation out to 2030**, which in turn affects where new high-demand loads (data centers, large industrial) may find favorable interconnection conditions after 2026.[1][3][5]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Broader Texas energy expansion context (relevant to future Hill County prospects)\n\nSeveral statewide trends will indirectly inform opportunities in Hill County even if local projects are not yet announced:\n\n- **Rapid load growth and risk of capacity shortfall**  \n  - Analyses of ERCOT indicate that without major new infrastructure, **system demand is expected to overtake available capacity during the 2026\u20132027 timeframe**, driven significantly by large loads such as data centers and industrial facilities.[5]  \n  - There are **2,500+ queued projects**, mostly solar and storage, awaiting transmission approvals or upgrades; interconnection waits of **3\u20135 years** are typical in congested areas.[5]  \n\n- **Massive build\u2011out of thermal, nuclear, and storage capacity**  \n  - Statewide plans include **about 130 new natural gas plants** and several **small modular reactor (SMR) initiatives**, plus rapid **battery storage expansion** to improve reliability and reduce blackout risk.[4]  \n  - Examples:  \n    - **X\u2011energy** and **Dow** plan an **Xe\u2011100 SMR** in **Seadrift, Texas**, to supply an industrial facility.[2]  \n    - **Last Energy** has announced **30 modular reactors** planned for **Haskell County, Texas**.[2]  \n    - **TerraPower** is exploring **co\u2011location of SMRs with data centers in Texas**, though no specific county-level siting has been publicly confirmed.[2]  \n\n- **Policy changes affecting large loads (including data centers)**  \n  - Measures such as **Senate Bill 6** require **large-scale users (data centers, crypto miners, etc.) to coordinate and share infrastructure costs**, incentivizing them to locate near robust transmission and generation hubs rather than weakly served rural nodes.[4]  \n  - This policy environment may make **counties with existing 345\u2011kV corridors and substations more attractive**\u2014a factor that could benefit parts of North\u2011Central Texas, potentially including Hill County, but no site-specific filings are evident yet.[4][5]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Data center development patterns near, but not in, Hill County\n\nCurrent **large data center announcements in Texas** are concentrated in other metro-adjacent regions:\n\n- A multi\u2011phase **Microsoft data center campus** has been filed **outside San Antonio**, with additional **Rowan** facilities in **Medina County (Hill Country)**.[2]  \n- These are hundreds of miles from Hill County and are tied to the San Antonio area grid, not to the Waco\u2013Dallas\u2013Fort Worth corridor that includes Hill County.[2]  \n\nGiven ERCOT\u2019s congestion and interconnection queues, developers have so far prioritized **major metros and established transmission hubs** over relatively rural counties like Hill. There is **no publicly sourced record of a named data center campus being sited in Hill County or immediately adjacent counties for post\u20112026 buildout**.["
