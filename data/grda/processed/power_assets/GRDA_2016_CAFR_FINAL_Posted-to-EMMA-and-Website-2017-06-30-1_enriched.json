All of these things in combination leads to an Authority resilient enough to be capable of overcoming obstacles as they arise. The Authority is not unique in Public Power in that a large portion of its workforce is eligible for retirement or is very near eligibility. Given these employees harbor decades of knowledge and experience, management has spent the last few years working on succession plans and providing leadership training, including the initiation of new training geared towards its supervisors and future supervisors.

Established in 1977, the OSRC mission was to protect, enhance, and preserve the outstanding aesthetic, historic, archaeological and scientific features of the Illinois River and other scenic rivers (Lee Creek, Little Lee Creek, Barren Fork Creek, Flint Creek, and the Upper Mountain Fork).

Three factors were considered in addition to the total economic impact of the Authority: Operating activities, Construction and investment activities, and Externalities and amenities. Highlights from this impact report detailed that GRDA was estimated to facilitate an annual economic activity effect of approximately $1 billion in Oklahoma’s economy during 2015 and 2016 as well as support over 7,100 jobs in Oklahoma.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS The Authority celebrated the receipt of two rating increases in 2016. The first came on October 6, 2016, with an announcement by Fitch that it was assigning an “A+” rating to the Authority’s Series 2016 Bonds. Fitch also upgraded GRDA’s Series 2008A, 2010A, 2010B, 2014A and 2014B Bonds to “A+” from “A” with a rating outlook revision to “Stable” from “Positive.” The following day, Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings announced that it would raise its long-term rating and underlying rating (SPUR) to “AA-“ from “A+” on GRDA’s earlier bonds and announced it was assigning an “AA-“ with a stable outlook to the 2016 series bonds."

These rating increases serve as testimony of the Authority’s continually improving financial position. In the early winter of 2015, GRDA held a groundbreaking at the Grand River Energy Center (GREC) for GREC 3, a 495 MW combined-cycle natural gas plant, with the first turbine/generator of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. Air-quality upgrades were also installed in the newest coal-fired generating unit, GREC 2, to meet Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). The Authority currently has firm wind purchases of 247 MW from Oklahoma wind farms, while another 140 MW is expected to be in service by late 2017. In combination with existing hydroelectric generation, these diverse resources allow the Authority to produce low-cost, reliable electricity for our customers while also exercising environmental stewardship.

OSRC was established by the legislature in 1977 to protect, enhance and preserve the Illinois River and its tributaries. While this allows the Authority to greatly expand its environmental stewardship, the financial impact to GRDA is expected to be minimal.

Costs to the Authority are expected to be materially limited to the $1.3 million insurance policy deductible. Two main events drove the results for the Authority in 2016. First, the previously mentioned fire at the GREC. See further discussion in Operating Results. Second, in November 2016, the Authority issued $496.4 million in revenue bonds, refunding existing debt and capitalizing on the opportunity for lower interest rates. The most significant changes of fiscal year 2015 related to the spending of bond proceeds for generation and transmission assets.

Net Position The Net Position increased by $3.4 million or 1% in 2016 following a $9.8 million or 2% increase in 2015. The increase in Net Position for 2016 was heavily influenced by the funding of a Rate Stabilization Account, which reduced current year revenue by deferring it to future years. This subsequently reduced the impact to Net Position by $21 million. See further discussion regarding the Rate Stabilization Account under “Operating Revenues.” GRDA’s industrial load increased in 2015 and again in 2016.

While liquidity had always been good, debt service coverage improved significantly as older debt was retired. At the same time, the Authority improved its revenue stream and worked to control risks, as well as secured the internal infrastructure. While risks with large financial impacts were prioritized and tackled first, risks such as the revenue stream, flooding mitigation, fuel supply, optimizing adequacy of generation supply with contracted customer loads, reliable transmission, and compliance and safety were also at the forefront. Through this, a goal driven, customer-focused utility with sustainable policies has emerged. The business experience and oversight of the Authority’s Board of Directors ensure that GRDA’s success continues and plans are implemented efficiently and effectively.

GRDA continues to engage in an educational mission to ensure legislators are informed of the many positive impacts GRDA has on Oklahoma and its communities. The Authority is humbled and further motivated by the active support of its customers, both municipal and industrial, with this effort. Municipal customers provide financial security with long-term contracts, enabling better future load projections. Long-term revenue projections are also more reliable as many of the all-requirements contracts with the municipal customers run two years longer than any outstanding debt. Additionally, relationships with WFEC and OMPA provide firm sales and diversification throughout the state of Oklahoma.

The customers GRDA serves under take-and-pay contracts are more diverse and service oriented than the state as a whole, so they don’t experience the upswings and downswings associated with oil and gas prices to the extent the rest of the state does.

The Authority has the power to control, store, preserve, and distribute the waters of the Grand River and its tributaries for any useful purpose and to develop and generate water power, electric power, and electric energy within the boundaries of the Authority and to buy, sell, resell, interchange, and distribute electric power and energy. The Grand River lies entirely within Oklahoma, but its drainage basin also extends over the states of Arkansas, Kansas, and Missouri.

Restricted—This component of net position consists of funds subject to constraints placed on net position use through external constraints imposed by creditors (such as through debt covenants), contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments or constraints imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

This ratio is then multiplied by the carrying value of the impaired assets. As a result, the Authority reduced the carrying amount of its electric plant and equipment by approximately $4,264,954 in 2016 along with an insurance recovery amount of $38,658,526.
