We update this data at least once a day.\n\n### Q: What is an ISO, RTO, and/or non-ISO utility?\n\nA: An Independent System Operator (ISO) or Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) is a non-profit organization that operates the high-voltage electric power transmission grid in a specific region, ensuring reliability and providing non-discriminatory access. ISOs and RTOs play a critical role in the electric power industry, helping to ensure that the grid is reliable and that electricity is delivered to consumers at a reasonable cost. Learn more about [ISOs and RTOs here.](https://www.ferc.gov/power-sales-and-markets/rtos-and-isos?ref=interconnection.fyi&utm_source=interconnection.fyi&utm_medium=referral) A non-ISO utility is an electric utility that does not operate under the umbrella of an ISO or RTO. Non-ISO utilities are typically smaller utilities that operate in rural or remote areas, facing challenges such as meeting the same reliability standards as ISOs and RTOs, but without the same resources and economies of scale.\n\n### Q: What is an interconnection queue?\n\nA: What is an interconnection queue?\n\nAn interconnection queue is a list of power generation and transmission projects that have requested to connect to the electric grid. The queue is managed by the grid operator, which is typically an independent system operator (ISO) or regional transmission organization (RTO).\n\n### Q: Why is the interconnection queue important?\n\nA: The interconnection queue is important because it ensures that new power generation and transmission projects can be safely and reliably connected to the grid. The grid operator reviews each project to assess its impact on the grid and to make sure that it will not compromise the reliability of the electric system. To learn more about interconnection queues, see this NPR Planet Money episode [\"Green Energy Gridlock\"](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1176462647/green-energy-transmission-queue-power-grid-wind-solar??ref=interconnection.fyi&utm_source=interconnection.fyi&utm_medium=referral) and [this article/podcast from Volts](https://www.volts.wtf/p/whats-the-deal-with-interconnection??ref=interconnection.fyi&utm_source=interconnection.fyi&utm_medium=referral).\n\n### Q: Where can I contact the owners, submit feature requests, get data, or submit an error?\n\nA: Please [email us](mailto:contact@interconnection.fyi) if you have any questions, see an error, want to request data, or have feature requests.\n\n### Q: Who are you?\n\nA: 👋 This tool is brought to you by [Chris Talley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophertalley/??ref=interconnection.fyi&utm_source=interconnection.fyi&utm_medium=referral) and [Steven Zhang](https://bit.ly/li-steven-zhang-interconnection??ref=interconnection.fyi&utm_source=interconnection.fyi&utm_medium=referral).
