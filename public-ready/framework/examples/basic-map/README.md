# Basic Map Example

This example shows the minimal setup of the framework:

- Renders the `BasicMap` component
- Uses a generic Mapbox style and example coordinates
- Does **not** include any proprietary logic or data

To run the basic example:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
