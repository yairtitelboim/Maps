## The Coordinate Problem

### Current Situation

**Our Database:**
- Coordinates: (31.9433, -97.3927)
- Point-in-polygon: **Hill County** ✅
- Location text: "bosque county"
- Geocode confidence: "address"

**Official DFW10:**
- Address: 557 County Rd 3610, Whitney, TX 76692
- County: **Bosque County** (per TDLR TABS filing TABS2025005284)
- Location: Adjacent to Thad Hill Energy Center

### The Discrepancy

**Problem:**
- ✅ Project IS DFW10 (confirmed by date, size, article content)
- ❌ Coordinates place it in **Hill County**
- ✅ But DFW10 is officially in **Bosque County**

**Explanation:**
- **Coordinate error** - Our geocoding placed the project in the wrong county
- Address "557 County Rd 3610" may not have geocoded precisely
- County border is very close to Whitney
- Geocoding service may have used approximate location

## Resolution

### What We Know

1. ✅ **This IS DFW10** - Confirmed by:
   - Exact announcement date match (July 30, 2025)
   - Size match (180 MW ≈ 190 MW)
   - Article mentions DFW10, Calpine, Thad Hill, Bosque County
   - Source article about $1.2B campus

2. ⚠️ **Coordinates are wrong** - Should be in Bosque County, not Hill County

3. ✅ **Location text is correct** - Says "bosque county"

### What Needs to Be Fixed

1. **Update County in Database**
   - Change from Hill County to Bosque County
   - Or verify coordinates are actually in Bosque County

2. **Fix Coordinates (if needed)**
   - Re-geocode with official address
   - Verify against TDLR filing coordinates
   - Check if coordinates need adjustment

3. **Update Project Name**
   - Consider renaming to "CyrusOne DFW10" or "CyrusOne Whitney Campus"
   - Currently named "CyrusOne bosque county"

## Implications for Hill County Analysis

### Hill County Data Center Count

**Before Fix:**
- Hill County: 2 data centers (point-in-polygon verified)
- But one of them is actually DFW10, which is in Bosque County

**After Fix:**
- Hill County: **1 data center** (the other project: "CyrusOne co")
- Bosque County: **1 data center** (DFW10)

### Updated Story

**Hill County:**
- **1 data center** (not 2)
- "CyrusOne co" (proj_ee843a3e2057) - 9.80 km from Whitney
- Status: Uncertain, size unknown

**Bosque County:**
- **1 data center** (DFW10)
- "CyrusOne bosque county" (proj_6c5910e85a48) - Actually DFW10
- 180 MW, announced July 30, 2025

---

## Conclusion

✅ **CONFIRMED:** Project "CyrusOne bosque county" (proj_6c5910e85a48) **IS DFW10**

**Evidence:**
- Exact announcement date match
- Size match (180 MW ≈ 190 MW)
- Article mentions DFW10, Calpine, Thad Hill
- Source article about $1.2B campus

**Issue:**
- Coordinates are wrong (in Hill County, should be Bosque County)
- Need to fix coordinates or update county assignment

**Impact:**
- Hill County has **1 data center** (not 2)
- Bosque County has **1 data center** (DFW10)
- This resolves the discrepancy
