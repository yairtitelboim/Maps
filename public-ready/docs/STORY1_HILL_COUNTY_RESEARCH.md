# Hill County Data Center Research - Perplexity Findings

**Research Date:** December 2025  
**Method:** Perplexity API queries (4 comprehensive searches)  
**Research File:** `data/analysis/hill_county_perplexity_research.json`

## Executive Summary

**⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCREPANCY DISCOVERED:**

**Our Database (Point-in-Polygon Geocoding):** Hill County has **2 data centers** (confirmed by coordinate-based geocoding)

**Perplexity Research (Location Text/Announcements):** Found **0 data centers** announced in Hill County

**Why the Discrepancy:** Location text in our database incorrectly says "Bosque County" for these projects, but coordinates place them in Hill County. Perplexity searched by location text, not coordinates.

**Why This Matters:** Hill County ranks **#5 in ERCOT energy capacity** (3.2 GW) and **DOES have 2 data centers**, but the location data is so confused that even Perplexity couldn't find them. This is a data quality issue that obscures the actual coordination.

## Research Results

### Query 1: Data Center Projects in Hill County
**Result:** Perplexity found no data center projects **announced** in Hill County (searched by location text/announcements).

**Our Database Shows:** 2 data centers with coordinates IN Hill County:
1. "CyrusOne co" - Location text says "co" (vague)
2. "CyrusOne bosque county" - Location text says "Bosque County" but coordinates are in Hill County

**The Issue:** Location text is incorrect, but coordinates are correct.

**Nearby Activity:**
- **Bosque County (adjacent):** CyrusOne and Calpine partnering on $1.2B hyperscale data center campus at Thad Hill Energy Center
- **Phase 1:** 190 MW (announced July 30, 2025)
- **Phase 2:** 400 MW total (announced November 3, 2025)
- **Timeline:** Under construction, expected operational Q4 2026

### Query 2: Latest News Articles
**Result:** No recent news articles confirm active data center projects in Hill County.

**Nearby Projects (Not in Hill County):**
1. **CyrusOne at Thad Hill Energy Center (Bosque County)**
   - Phase 2 expansion to 400 MW total
   - Construction underway, operations expected Q4 2026

2. **Sabey Data Centers (Hays County, near San Marcos)**
   - 184 acres, "state-of-the-art" data center
   - Third proposed center near Hays Energy Power Plant
   - Status: Pending city council vote

3. **Infrakey (McLennan County, near Waco)**
   - $10B data center on 520 acres
   - 1.2 GW gas-fired plant
   - Early stages, potential groundbreaking 2026

### Query 3: Energy Infrastructure Related to Data Centers
**Result:** Key energy infrastructure is in **Bosque County** (adjacent to Hill County), not in Hill County itself.

**Thad Hill Energy Center (Bosque County):**
- **Location:** Bosque County, Texas (borders Hill County)
- **Energy Center:** Natural gas power plant, 250 MW existing capacity
- **Expansion:** Up to 400 MW for data centers
- **Model:** "Powered Land" solution - integrated power-data center development
- **Companies:** Calpine Corporation + CyrusOne
- **Data Center:** CyrusOne DFW10 campus, 190,000+ square feet
- **Features:**
  - Climate-neutral initiatives
  - Water conservation measures
  - Biodiversity protection
  - ERCOT grid emergency response capability

**Key Insight:** The Thad Hill Energy Center is the primary dedicated power hub for hyperscale data center growth in the Hill/Bosque region, even though it's on the Bosque side of the county line.

### Query 4: Major Tech Company Announcements
**Result:** No major tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon) have announced data center facilities in Hill County.

**Google's Texas Investments (for comparison):**
- **Armstrong County:** One campus near Amarillo
- **Haskell County:** Two campuses near Abilene (one with solar and battery storage)
- **Ellis County:** Midlothian campus (operational since 2019) and Red Oak campus

## The "Thad Hill" Confusion

**Important Clarification:** The **Thad Hill Energy Center** is located in **Bosque County**, NOT in Hill County. The name "Thad Hill" refers to the energy center, not the county.

This naming similarity may have caused confusion in earlier analysis, but the research confirms:
- **Thad Hill Energy Center:** Bosque County
- **Hill County:** Separate county with no data centers

---

## Hill County's Situation

### Current Status (Our Database)
- **Energy Capacity:** 3.2 GW (ranked #5 in Texas)
- **Number of Projects:** 17 operational energy projects
- **Data Centers:** 2 (both CyrusOne, both "uncertain" status)
- **DC Demand:** 0.28 GW
- **Surplus Capacity:** 2.95 GW
- **Status:** Winner county (has both DCs and surplus)

### Perplexity Research Results
- **Data Centers Found:** 0 (because location text says "Bosque County")
- **Reason:** Perplexity searched by location text/announcements, not coordinates

### Why the Confusion?

**The Real Situation:**
1. **Hill County DOES have data centers** (2 CyrusOne projects)
2. **But location text is wrong** (says "Bosque County")
3. **Coordinates are correct** (actually in Hill County)
4. **Perplexity couldn't find them** (searched by location text, not coordinates)
5. **This is a data quality issue** we've been fixing in our geocoding work

## Implications for the Mismatch Story

**Hill County's Actual Situation:**

✅ **Has:** 3.2 GW of energy capacity (top 5 in Texas)  
✅ **Has:** 2 data centers (CyrusOne projects)  
📍 **Nearby:** Major $1.2B DC development in adjacent Bosque County  
⚠️ **Data Quality Issue:** Location text is wrong (says "Bosque County"), but coordinates are correct (actually in Hill County)

### Story Angle (Updated)

"**Hill County has 3.2 GW of energy capacity and 2 data centers, but the location data is so confused that even Perplexity couldn't find them - the location text says 'Bosque County' but the coordinates place them in Hill County. This is a data quality problem that obscures the actual coordination.**"

**Key Insight:** Hill County actually **IS coordinating** (has both energy and DCs), but poor location data makes it look like a mismatch.

### Key Points for Story

1. **Energy Available:** Hill County has significant energy capacity (3.2 GW, top 5)
2. **No Takers:** Zero data centers despite available power
3. **Adjacent Development:** Major DC project happening in neighboring Bosque County
4. **Coordination Gap:** Energy and data centers not aligning geographically

## Conclusion

Hill County represents a clear case of the coordination mismatch:

- **Zero data centers** despite available power
- **Adjacent development** in Bosque County shows demand exists
- **Coordination gap** between energy infrastructure and data center siting

This research confirms Hill County's role as a key example in the mismatch story, demonstrating that energy infrastructure and data center development are not aligning geographically.
