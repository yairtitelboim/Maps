  - **Average US state:** ~25 GW → Hill = 13% of average state
  - **Small country (Ireland):** ~10 GW → Hill = 32% of Ireland
  - **Large city (NYC peak):** ~12 GW → Hill = 27% of NYC peak demand
  - **Average Texas county:** ~0.33 GW → Hill = 10x average county

### 8. Data Center Industry Context
- **Hill County capacity:** 3.23 GW
- **Typical hyperscale DC:** 0.5-1.0 GW
- **→ Hill can power 3-6 hyperscale data centers**
- **Largest DC campus (e.g., Meta Frontier):** ~1.4 GW
- **→ Hill can power 2.3 of the world's largest DC campuses**

### 9. Growth Potential
- **Current surplus:** 2.95 GW
- **Can support:**
  - **30 more 100 MW data centers**
  - **6 more 500 MW hyperscale data centers**
  - **2 more 1 GW mega-campuses**

### Key Takeaway

**Hill County's 3.23 GW is massive for a single county:**
- It's the 5th largest energy capacity county in Texas
- It's 10x the average Texas county
- It's 32% of Ireland's total grid capacity
- It can power multiple hyperscale data center campuses
- It's 75% renewable (solar/wind dominant)

**This is why Hill County is a "winner" - it has exceptional energy infrastructure for its size.**
