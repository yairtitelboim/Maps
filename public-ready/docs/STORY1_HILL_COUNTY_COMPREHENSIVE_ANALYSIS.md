  - These projects shape ERCOT grid topology but don't pass through Hill County
- **Statewide Energy Expansion:**
  - ~130 new natural gas plants planned
  - Small modular reactors (SMRs) - X-energy/Dow, Last Energy (30 reactors in Haskell County)
  - TerraPower exploring SMR co-location with data centers
- **Policy Impact:** Senate Bill 6 requires large users to coordinate infrastructure costs

## Data Quality Notes

**Our Database vs. Perplexity Research:**
- Our database shows 2 data centers in Hill County (point-in-polygon geocoding)
- Location text incorrectly says "Bosque County" for some projects
- Perplexity searched by location text/announcements, not coordinates
- This creates a discrepancy that highlights data quality issues

**Recommendation:** Use coordinate-based geocoding (point-in-polygon) as the source of truth, not location text.
