## 📈 Discovery Potential Estimate

### Conservative Estimate
- **Current:** 44 projects
- **Additional discoverable:** 30-50 projects
- **Total potential:** 74-94 projects

### Optimistic Estimate
- **Current:** 44 projects
- **Additional discoverable:** 60-100 projects
- **Total potential:** 104-144 projects

### Factors Affecting Discovery

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Coverage Gap:** We're likely missing 50-100+ projects, especially from:
   - Equinix (major gap)
   - Vantage (growing AI operator)
   - Smaller regional operators
   - Projects announced before 2024

2. **Geographic Bias:** Current queries favor major metros. Need to expand to:
   - Suburban/rural areas (where many hyperscale campuses are)
   - Secondary cities
   - Industrial corridors

3. **Company Diversity:** Heavy focus on hyperscalers (Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon). Need more:
   - Colocation providers (Equinix, Digital Realty, CyrusOne)
   - Regional operators
   - Specialized operators (AI/ML, edge)

4. **Status Tracking:** 39 projects have "unknown" status. Need to:
   - Improve status detection
   - Add follow-up queries for status updates
   - Cross-reference with ERCOT interconnection queue
