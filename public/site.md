## **THE 7 STRATEGIC PROJECTS ANCHORING WHITNEY, TX**

### **1. CYRUSONE DFW7 DATA CENTER CAMPUS**  
**Location:** 557 County Road 3610, Whitney, TX  
**Scale:** Multi-phase hyperscale campus master-planned for 400+ MW and more than 1 million sq ft of technical space; Phase 1 shell is rising with dual-fed transmission service  
**Status:** Under construction with phased energization beginning 2025  
**Significance:** Establishes Whitney as a North Texas edge for hyperscale compute, attracting ancillary power, water, and fiber investments

---

### **2. ONCOR WHITNEY SUBSTATION & TRANSMISSION HUB**  
**Location:** North Whitney along FM 933, tying into ERCOT’s North-Central zone  
**Scale:** 138 kV switching station with dual 345 kV feeds and redundant distribution transformers supporting data center and regional load growth  
**Status:** Oncor’s 2024–2026 grid-hardening program includes breaker replacements, relay upgrades, and station automation retrofits  
**Significance:** Provides the resiliency backbone that enables large-scale, high-availability computing in Bosque County

---

### **3. BOSQUE COUNTY POWER STATION**  
**Location:** Laguna Park, southwest of Whitney  
**Scale:** ≈750 MW combined-cycle natural gas facility (2x1 configuration) with black-start capability feeding ERCOT’s North load pocket  
**Status:** Mid-life turbine restaging and emissions-control upgrades scheduled through 2026 to extend dispatchable capacity  
**Significance:** Primary flexible generation source balancing intermittent renewables and providing contingency support for DFW7

---

### **4. LAKE WHITNEY DAM & HYDRO MODERNIZATION**  
**Location:** Brazos River, downstream of Whitney  
**Scale:** U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam with 30 MW hydroelectric plant; 2023–2027 investment program covers spillway gate rehabilitation, piezometer replacement, and digital instrumentation  
**Status:** Construction underway with staged gate closures; hydro units receiving new exciters and turbine governors  
**Significance:** Fortifies flood control and peaking capacity while safeguarding the lake that drives Whitney’s recreation economy

---

### **5. AQUILLA REGIONAL WATER TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION**  
**Location:** Aquilla, east of Whitney  
**Scale:** Brazos River Authority facility expanding toward 25 MGD with new membrane trains, solids-handling upgrades, and SCADA modernization  
**Status:** Design-build contract awarded in 2024; phased cutovers planned through Q2 2026 to maintain supply continuity  
**Significance:** Secures potable water for Bosque, Hill, and McLennan counties—including cooling and domestic demand for the DFW7 campus

---

### **6. BOSQUE RIVER SOLAR + STORAGE PROJECT**  
**Location:** Meridian ETJ, northwest Bosque County  
**Scale:** Planned 200 MWac solar array with 100 MW / 400 MWh battery energy storage, interconnected at Oncor’s Bosque Junction  
**Status:** Interconnection studies completed in 2023; construction start targeted for late 2025 pending final financing  
**Significance:** Diversifies the Bosque load pocket with renewables, offering peak-shaving capability for data center operations

---

### **7. HILCO ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE OPERATIONS CENTER**  
**Location:** 115 Jill Lane, Whitney, TX  
**Scale:** 40,000 sq ft control, training, and logistics campus coordinating 21,000 member meters, fiber-to-the-premise rollouts, and storm response  
**Status:** Facility entered service in 2022; ongoing investments in ADMS, outage analytics, and broadband headend equipment continue through 2025  
**Significance:** Modernizes rural distribution reliability and creates a skilled workforce pipeline that supports Whitney’s growing digital economy

---

## **KEY OBSERVATIONS**

1. **Digital Load Anchor:** The DFW7 campus drives simultaneous upgrades across power, water, and fiber systems—positioning Whitney as a strategic overflow node for the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.  
2. **Generation Diversity:** Firm gas generation (Bosque County Power Station) pairs with emerging solar-plus-storage to create a balanced resource mix within a 20-mile radius.  
3. **Water–Energy Nexus:** Lake Whitney and Aquilla facilities deliver the raw water, flood mitigation, and regulatory compliance required for long-term data center scalability.  
4. **Grid Resilience Investments:** Oncor and HILCO programs replace legacy equipment, add automation, and increase redundancy, reducing the risk profile for hyperscale tenants.  
5. **Regional Workforce & Services:** Cooperative training centers and construction activity generate skilled labor opportunities, supporting both critical infrastructure and local economic development.
