**Analysis Summary:**

- The **Downtown Core block (gentrification_block_1)** is the most vulnerable, becoming unaffordable within 12 months due to *very high investment density*, *proximity to multiple FIFA investment features*, and *zero residential listings*, indicating an acute displacement risk in the commercial hub area.

- The **Midtown block (gentrification_block_3)** follows with a 15-month timeline, driven by *moderate investment density* and *transit corridor access*, which supports rapid development and displacement despite fewer FIFA features nearby.

- The **EaDo district block (gentrification_block_2)**, while adjacent to no high-priority FIFA features, still faces high displacement risk due to its *event zone status* and *lack of residential listings*, with an 18-month timeline to unaffordability. This suggests indirect FIFA investment effects via event-driven gentrification.

All three blocks share a high development momentum score (7.7), indicating strong ongoing development pressures that FIFA investments will likely accelerate, increasing displacement vulnerability in these downtown Houston areas.
