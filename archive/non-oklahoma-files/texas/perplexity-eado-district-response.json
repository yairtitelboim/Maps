The high walkability and clustering values indicate good foundational conditions, but the low conversion scores suggest that factors such as economic viability, public investment, and amenity diversity need improvement before strong conversion candidates emerge.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nFocus on enhancing economic incentives, increasing amenity diversity beyond restaurants/cafes, and leveraging the FIFA Fan Festival legacy for public investment to boost office-to-residential conversion potential in this zone.\n\n---\n\nIf you require GeoJSON features for the existing candidates despite their lower scores, I can provide those as well."
